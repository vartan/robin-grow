# Robin Grow Experimental (modified for comma separated multi-channel listening, colors, channel selection! Amazing!)

This is not the main branch! But it has some great additional features!

Special thanks to OrangeredStilton, Voltaek, and dashed.

## Installation
Install a userscript extension such as greasemonkey or tampermonkey:  
Click here: http://tampermonkey.net


Then, click this link to install the script:  
https://github.com/5a1t/robin-grow/raw/master/robin.user.js

If you get a bunch of code instead of it installing, you can copy and paste the code as a new script in greasemonkey/tampermonkey.
