# Now with 100% Less Spam!

Step 1: Install a userscript extension such as greasemonkey or tampermonkey:

Click here: http://tampermonkey.net


Then, click this link to install the script:

https://github.com/vartan/robin-grow/raw/master/robin.user.js

If you get a bunch of code instead of it installing, you can copy and paste the code as a new script in greasemonkey/tampermonkey.
